We using security onion to find a malware in our network. file traffic network can download here:  
[file pcap](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/training-exercises.html)  
First, open file pcap by wireshark and take a look to see if anything is wrong.  
In the filter, type:
```
http.request
```
Here is all http request traffic:

All network traffic is related the system has ip *192.168.22.94* and in column **host** we can see some strange domain.
So we should replay network traffic from this file to see what happened.  
Open terminal and type:  
```
tcpreplay -t -i [interface] [path to file pcap]
```  
The result:

All traffic network were replayed in the system and their event were wrote by **Sguil**, a collection of free software components  
for Network Security Monitoring (NSM) and event driven analysis of IDS alerts

Yes! This can be a host of the malware. So the system ip *192.168.22.94* was attacked by malware.  
To find the name of this system, return wireshark in the filter type:  
```
ip.src == 192.168.22.94 and udp.dstport == 67
```
